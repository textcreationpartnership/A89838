         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>So the whore to defile others hath laid open her own skirts; A sufficient warning to all that love their souls, to see to their foundation, and standing; and fly her filthy aluring language and practice, and prove their foundation by the life of the Saints, before they build thereon.</p>

            <p>In thy confused minde thou runs over many of thy worships thou wast in at <hi>Rome,</hi> not worth the mentioning after thee; which thou left (as thou sayest) because thou couldst not understand their language. Then thou sayest thou camest to the reformation into a Cathedrall, and with the Organs thou was well pleased, and to such foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish musick and worship thou sayest thou joyned thy heart and voyce and understanding, and of all thy gadding ways it seems this thou likest best, as suting most to thy light vaine minde, for here thou sayest thou stayed, till fear of an alteration possest thee; then thou turned too like the Preists as well without as with a surplise, where thou plainly shewes what principle led thee all along, who ever kept thee ready to change as times, and thy fears moved, and these and other superstitious things thou sets down as a thing past, and with a vaine minde makes a scoffe of thy folly, but blinde beast cannot see thy selfe got no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, then those filthy Popish traditions of men, which with corrupt mindes they hold up for their own ends, which thou art still pleading for, calling the Papists hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Churches, and the Popish Bishop made Preists, that still in that generation beget one another, calling them Christs ministers when not one thing they performe in those Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish house<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, is so much as in the forme of the Saints wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and yet in thy filthy minde would wrest <hi>Pauls</hi> words, who never worshipped in those places, but called out of them, and said, <hi>God dwelt not in them;</hi> and when at any time he went into them, it was not to worship in them, as thou would wrest it, but to dispute against them, and such a worship as now is performed in them; yet art thou not ashamed to bring his words to prove them; and him who was not a minister of man, nor made by man, nor the will of man, him thou brings to prove the practice of the hirelings, begetting one another in their own wills, all for gaine, but if any preach freely him they persecute, such practice <hi>Pauls</hi> words will not warrant: and because no Scripture there is, that will prove their practice herein,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168165:4"/> thou art forc't to bottom their foundation with a lye, which thou thy selfe makes, saying, that ere <hi>Paul</hi> was sent any message to preach, he was ordained of the Church, and this is thy proofe, saying, try <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 3. where <hi>Paul</hi> was seperated to goe to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and this thou sayest was done ere he had any message to preach, but if thou read <hi>Galations</hi> 1. or <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 27. there thou mayest see thy selfe proved a lyar, and perverter of the Scriptures, and yet with thy whores forehead art not afraid to say, it is what the spirit of God hath given thee to speak; and this is thy spirituall converted Quaker, who art turn'd an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent lyar, even of the Spirit of God himselfe, and thus the Devill hath not lost his labour on thee, in leading thee thus long; but now he hath begotten thee to himselfe wholly, and thou art become his bold fac'd childe, so that when he begets a lye in thee thou art not ashamed to bring it forth into the world, even against the truth it selfe, by which thou art judged from the beginning, and the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of plaine Scripture is against thee, which all that read may witnesse: yet art thou so hardned in thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as thou art not ashamed to put thy folly in Print, to be seen of all the world, so that thou mayest but have the least hope to preserve thy fathers kingdome, by casting thy filthinesse upon the truth, for this ever is the way of Satan to act wickednesse, but never own it further then to make truth odious, which is the onely thing that troubles his kingdome: and in thy Paper thou hast clearly acted his part, laying open so many of his filthy movings, and actings in thee, onely to cast them upon us, all which we deny, and thy end thou shalt not accomplish; for did but all the Nation know our practice, as well as they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to beleeve lies against us, there had been no need to have writ any thing for clearing the truth, which as it spreads shall clear it selfe; and thou begins to shew thy filthy wayes, to cast them upon us, shewing that thou wast Popishly affected; and joyned to that filthy Idoll, then to the Bishops and Priests which are the Popes children, all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168165:4"/> which we deny, and all their forms of worship as being distant from the foundation of truth, upon which we stand; and though thy selfe be amongst them still, yet thou layes open their skirts, if so be thou might but cast some of their shame upon us, when its well known that the Papists, thou and the Priests, are all joyned together against us, for the truths sake; though in some cerimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies your own carnall ends breeds quarels amongst your selves, and neither their reproach nor thine, can lye upon us, for the day is come, and they must bear the shame that is found in the shamefull worke: the Devill can hide himselfe no longer, with reproching others and thats the cause of his rage.</p>
            <p>Then thou sayest thou left the railes, and went to hear one who had brought them from the Table to the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. I say, amongst these railers thou art it, railing against the truth, and pleading for them, though this thou speaks to cast upon us.</p>
            <p>Then thou tells of thy brotherhood among the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents. Truly they had lost their savour that tooke thee for a brother, but thy running wit (it seems) led thee to think, that all that suffered thee to hear them ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee for a brother.</p>
            <p>Then thou sayest thou met one of thy old acquaintance, who told thee of a spirituall teaching, and wisht thee to look within, and brought thee Scripture for it, but this (it seems) thou hadst no minde to follow.</p>
            <p>Then thou sayest thou met with <hi>George Fox,</hi> who told thee that thou wast wading in a whirlepoole who helped thee out, and then confirmed thou hadst Christ in thee; and shee came after that brought the bottle, and with once tasting thou was perfect. To which I say, if thou wast not, and yet art wading in a whirpoole, let any wise man judge that reads thy Booke, and sees thy frantick ways thou walkes in, but that ever thou knew Christ, or his spirit in thee to guide thee: I know <hi>George Fox</hi> would never confirme to thee, for who knowes Christ in them is

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168165:7"/> if I and thou would but performe the same to them, as their followers did to the Apostles, this bramble bush would be converted into a lilly: I answer, when they come out of their great livings, to do the Apostles work then let him beare his sin, who refuses to give the Apostles wages, till then I say the same of him, who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Ministers of Christ, leads the lusts of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Antichrist, thou tells of some of them, who before they will loose their benefits, they will agree to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, subscribe the Scotch Covenant, go to the mass schoole and learn to say masse, and these thou sayes was the false Prophets <hi>Peter</hi> spoke of, which makes merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of soules; I answer, so they was and so they are but with thy blinde eye thou canst not see it, yet hast thou gone so far in laying open the deceipt of some, as thou hast proved them all guilty, and so they must passe till thou instance one, who hath not conformed to the times, or those filthinesse thou hast mentioned, and thus thou hast excused them till they be all left without excuse, and now look back and see thy Divines their practice, their fruits, and thy own blindnesse, and there in the mud I leave thee and them, and neither <hi>Deut:</hi> nor any other Scripture thou canst bring, proves means or mainteinance for such a Ministry, nor did ever <hi>Paul</hi> ordaine these or any such, but from the Pope they have ordained one another, without that <hi>Paul</hi>-like vision thou tells on, and their hands being poluted, on whom they lay them are defiled, and taking up a forme without the power is the petty treason thou speaks on, for who walks in the way before mentioned, hath not the spirit, therefore cannot give it to others, though with the Magissions of <hi>Aegypt</hi> they may make Serpents.</p>
            <p>To slander us further thou sayes, the Magistrates to you are no Magistrates, neither will you call any man father, nor use any reverence to persons of dignity, you would have a party which at length would prove a disparety; I answer, these things thou takes to your selfe, and so let

            <p>Thou sayes the word ye terme a dead letter, and tells of Christ mauling the Devill with an old Text, and many such things in thy vaine thoughts thou imagin and talkes of; To which I say, thou that calls the word a dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knows not the word but art blinde, and we deny thee herein with the light, with which we know the living word and the dead letter, as the children of light have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done, and thy conjured word of a declarative word we deny, with the living word of which the letter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, and that which Christ resisted the Devil with thou knowest not, who saith it was an old Text, for thou hast read many Texts, and yet the Devil lives unmauld in thee, who art a lyar and blasphemer, out of the light (as

            <p>Thou sayes people who are not of the same opinion with you, you look squintly on with a scornful reproach; I say, so it seems by thy Paper, which thou hast filled with scorne and reproach, to cast upon us, who denyes all your popish opinions, and here thou hast declared thy scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nature, by which thou hast been led &amp; now lives in, and God scornes thee who art a scorner, and this sentence of condemnation, I passe upon thee, which God hath passed upon all the generation of scorners; Thou tells of seeing role of predestination; I say thy blinde eye thats out of the light of Christ, is far from seeing predestination or election, thou art so blinded by the Prince of darknesse, thou cannot see thy selfe to be a reprobate, who makes a scoffe at Christ being within thee, and this is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the words of the Bible thou tells on, but with the Scripture thou art tryed, and found so to be.</p>
            <p>Thou tells of people wearing apparell beyond their calling, which thou sayes is not the pride the Spirit speaks of, for that Serpent lyes in the heart; I answer, doth not the spirit call to moderation in apparell, and spoke forth Scripture to that purpose, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9, 10. which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever exceeds goes beyond their calling, which here thou art pleading for, and thus the Serpent (thou tells on) is found in thy own heart pleading for his owne kingdome of pride and filthinesse, yet to hide him with thou wouldst cast a mist, by telling of <hi>Solomons</hi> robes, but thou that art of <hi>Ishmaels</hi> brood, knows <hi>Hamans</hi> robes better then <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and this pride and respect of persons thou art plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for, which <hi>Solomon</hi> never did, and when thou hast pleaded against what the Scripture calls to, then thou wishes that all may be performed according to the Bible, and here thou wouldst cover thy selfe with a vaine wish, who hast been teaching contrary to Scripture, but when

            <p>Thou tells further how near you run to the abscondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties if not absurdities of the Papists; I answer, thou need not conjure up such words, to declare your nearnesse to the Papists, for in plainesse of speech we who are come out from among you, do declare you to be one with them against the Lambs of Christ, and your worship all arising from one roote, and leading to one end, onely your devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion arises about carnal things, as steeplehouses and tythes and so forth, who should have them, the Papists say they are theirs by antiquity, as being the first founders, but you say they are yours by reformation, but the Saints of God had never ought to do amongst you, except it be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare against you; And thou sayes you are posting on the same roade with the Papists, without a guide to Tyburne, and such vaine words thy airy spirit vomits forth: To which I answer, without a guide you are who are out of the light, and your posting is to make Papists and Athiests (as thou sayes) which are all made out of the light, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can you make any but such as your selves, such as you sow, such you must reap, and so your posting is to distruction, and take others with you though you escape Tyburne.</p>
            <p>Then thou tells of seeking the Radix of your prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous wayes, in thy mad seeking thou findes windmills and whirling about and gusts of winde, which thou utters out in thy vaine minde, and sayes, thou couldst never be resolved; I say thou art guided by thy imaginations, proud and lofty thoughts, windmils and gusts of winde whirling about, being dislocated from thy center as thou sayes, and out of the light, what place is there left in thee to be resolved or setled in the truth, so long as that figin minde leads thee, but art like the horse or mule, which cannot be guided without bit or hook: great plagues remaines for such, and though thou confesses thou couldst
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168165:9"/> never be resolved in our way, yet with thy inference (as thou sayes) thou judgest, and with thy ignorant inference thou findes the first Radix as thou calls it, of those distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to be ignorance, and so with thy ignorance thou goes about to discover ignorance in us, and cannot see so much ignorance in thy selfe as to stop thy mouth, yet with this ignorance thou confesses thou read the Scriptures, framing Expositions with thy owne private spirit, and with thy own thoughts judgest of them; I answer, with what spirit else couldst thou read them, who art out of the light of Christ, and therefore must needs read them and judge them with thy darke thoughts, and here thou layes open thy owne condition, in subtilty to cast it upon us, who by the light of Christ and his spirit, have those darke thoughts and private spirit judged in us, by which thou art guided, and read the Scriptures still, wresting them to maintaine pride respect of persons, the hirelings worship <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which things the Spirit that gave forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which we are guided did ever beare witnes against, and this ignorance thou calls thy first Radix, and yet in this thy ignorance, thou blinde sot would be a judge and teacher of others.</p>
            <p>Thy second Radix is thy selfish principle or finister end; which (thou sayes) thy experience holds out, upon which thou sayes thou gave thy vote for taking away the Idol of Tythes, onely in hope to gaine thine own part, which thou usest to pay, and this thou wouldest cast upon us, and bids us try our wayes: I answer, here thy deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart is tryed, and that spirit by which thou art gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: thy zeal for Christ and the true God, who though thou sees Tythes to be an Idol (with that which is thy condemnation) yet thou art not incited to beare witnesse against that Idol, but from a selfish principle, and here the Beaff and the false Prophet is found in thee, and in this beastly minde, the Devil leads thee to judge others like thy selfe.</p>
            <p>Thy third Radix thou sayes is pride, and this thou
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168165:10"/> sayes thou hast by experience, for thou thought thy selfe no wit inferiour to the greatest, because the Text saith, <hi>God is no respecter of persons,</hi> and now thou sayes, thou thought thou was grown wise, because thou couldst give the language <hi>Thou,</hi> and keep on thy hat, when thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses the ground why thou kept on thy hat was least any should espie more haire then wit: I answer, such is the wisdome of God, and his worke now to leave such as thee to lay open your owne shame before all men, who would set your selves to oppose the truth, as thou dost manifest throughout thy Paper, that filthy spirit by which thou art guided, and shews out thy venome, but cannot come to thy purpose, which if thy filthinesse should be laid open by another it might not be so easily beleived, especially by such as know not the depth of Satan, by whose principle thou plainly appears to have been carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all along different from us, as light and darknesse, for we that follow Christ seeing God to be no respecter of persons, are therefore lead out of our selves out of the nature where pride lodges, which God respects not, into that which God respects as they who knew God and Christ ever was, and all may see thy principles which leads thee when the humility of God lead thee to pride, and here thou art seperated from us and thy end and the use of Scripture which thou makes we deny. As for the language <hi>Thou,</hi> we owne it, as all the Saints in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ever did, and the keeping on the hat, in obedience to a meek spirit, not from thy cursed corrupt proud princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For thy other vaine light words they are not worth mentioning after thee.</p>
            <p>Thy fourth Radix thou sayes is wilfulnesse, and this (as thou sayest) thou art taught by thy owne experience, for thou would hear no reproofe against thy way: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, thou art in the same condition still, though thy blinde eye cannot see it, and in thy owne way thou art, lying and slandering shewing forth thy owne folly and wickednesse, wherein thou hast traded all along: And

Many more vaine words thou usest, telling how thou wast carried contrary to all commentaries, telling of sounding brasse and tinkling Cymballs, things thou knowes nothing of but by hearsay, thou never came so far yet as a tinkling Cymball, but art brazened out of the form, and therefore thy brasse sounds shamefully; thou sayes thy affections was averse to the voyce of a Minister, and that was the reason Christ left off his miracles among the natives, here thou speaks thou knows not what, Christ never owned such a Ministry as thou pleads for, neither could they ever owne his miracles as now they nor thou cannot practice, who denyes him and his light, and it had been more profitable for thee, to have seen the cause why Christ has left thee, glorying in thy shame, casting up thy dirt and mud to defile others, but thou art blinde of that eye, thou sayes thou hast forgot that learning taught thee to read the Bible, and so to hear of God; I say it had been better for thee never to have read the Scriptures, then thus to abuse and wrest them for the Devills service and to thy owne destruction, so had it been better for thee never to have heard of God, then thus to talke on him in thy light minde, and live out of his feare as thou dost, and so cause his name to be blasphemed by such beastly wayes as thou lives in, as in thy Paper is declared, and the day is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on apace, when it shall be manifold more easie for them that never heard of God nor Scripture then for

            <p>Now thou follows with an exhortation, (turn againe to the Lord) but this voyce thou sayes thou wouldst not hear till a strange kinde of inward susarration from whence thou knowes not seased upon thy soule: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that voyce that should turne thee to the Lord thou still refuses and never heard it nor turned to him, but by that voyce thou knowes not from whence thou art still guided, and here be witnesse against thy selfe, that thou art guided thou knowest not by what, nor from whence thy guide comes, and all that read thy book may see thou art going thou knowes not whither, and yet busie body would be a guide to others. Then thou sayes, thou was invited by thy singular good friend <hi>Cynothiticon</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse a little with a Minister; to which I say, thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to be guided thou knewest not by what, was in the fittest condition to be led with the blinde, to go to such as thou calls Ministers, for such silly women they lead, who have lost their guide laden with divers lusts, where thou hast been wading; for to none but such can they wrest the Scriptures, and lead them so blinde till they make them beleeve, that the words of <hi>Paul</hi> (who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered up and down and had no certaine dwelling place, suffered hunger and nakednesse coveted no mans Silver or Gold but wrought with his hands least he should be chargeable to any) will prove it lawfull for them to have a great house to live in, two or three hundred a year to maintaine them in pride and idlenesse, and for this they may s<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thou sayes he told thee of a house, ye know by the spirit, made without hands eternall in the heavens: I say, that house is not known to the hireling that seek his house here, nor to thy spirit of susuration which came thou knewst not from whence, nor to no such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Esaus</hi> is that birth-right known, who beare rule over their brethren by earthly things, whose heart is in the old creation knows nothing of the new, though he and thou may talke of it, to satisfie your vaine mindes, as many other things thou sayes he told thee, and framed morralls to convince thee of thine errour and confirme thee in the truth, but hadst thou not been blinde and out of the light of Christ, thou mightest have known that it is the Spirit of Christ that convinces of errours, and not morralls formed by Antichrist nor his Ministers for their owne ends which thou sayes he led thee too, holding forth that all should communicate to them that teach, but he that spoke this had it not for framing morralls, but for sowing spiritualls, but from this (sayest thou) he drew a conclusion concerning the necessity of teaching for eternity; to which I say, I knew before thou toldst me that their necessity of teaching lay here, and still is drawn from that conclusion, that earthly things may be communicated to them, for were it not for that, they might teach that would for them or any other necessity that lyes upon them; I never yet knew that necessity laid upon any of them to call them to a people where there is nothing to be gotten, neither will they suffer others to go to such if they can hinder it, least thereby their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be spoiled, and these are the Ministers made by the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168165:12"/> will of man, and this is their necessity which they would conclude for eternity, but from what Scripture did he prove that their teaching should endure to eternity? It <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thou sayest (turne againe to the Lord) it points out the butt or marke at which all the arrows of thy inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thoughts words and actions should be shot: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the arrows of thy inventions and vaine thoughts wicked words and filthy actions, flies abroad through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Nation in this filthy Book, and against the Lamb and his truth hast thou shot them, woe unto thee who hast no other but to shoot thy inventions at, for thee is the sword of the almighty furbished, and with his arrows shalt thou be scattered, and thy generation and brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood thou tells of, with all your inventions, and the way thou hast chosen, shall fall upon thy owne head, and the

            <p>Thou sayes that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> having received that rayling letter takes not upon himselfe, but sends for the Prophet to pray, and here the lyar speaks in thee againe, for <hi>Hezekiah</hi> spread the letter before the Lord and prayed, neither sent he for the Prophet, but to the Prophet to pray, though thou sayes he admits of none but who was for that office to speak in publick, as though <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had excluded some from praying in that case, doubleing the lye two or three sold to make thy cords strong to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the hireling, which is all the refuge they have to hold

               <p>That you all take heed how you beleive reports, from selfe ended men guided by corrupt principles against the truth, who would render it odious to establish their deceit wherein they live, &amp; so you be found fighters against God, you having seen what he hath don to those who withstood him before you, and they are taken away, and you are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished; (oh that you saw the hand by which it is done) now this God requires at your hands, that you stop not his work, nor hinder his spirituall kingdome, thereby thinking to establish your owne, for which you see he hath overthrown kingdomes, neither think to stop the truth, by putting the bodyes of such where it is risen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to holes and prisons, for hereby you shall but (<hi>Pharaoh</hi> like) see it faster to grow, and increase your owne plagues, which all that loves God would have his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to escape.</p>
               <p>But if any of you do so much owne justice as that with an honest heart you say, you would not have a hand in opposing the truth if you knew it, but what you doe is to stop errours, and you here many loud cries against this way, and its every where evill spoken on, and some say we are sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> that we are Jesuits, Franciscan Friers, and the like; To such Magistrates I say, you have us in the Nation, and our accusers, and we have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in corners, let us be called before you and our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, and if so we be proved let us suffer, but if not why should this reproach lye upon the truth to be a stumblng block to you; but if it be said, though we be free borne, and have been freinds to the truth and to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, yet now we are turned seducers and teach errors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To that I say you have the Scriptures, which shewes the Saints lives, wherein they taught and walked, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in errors was judged; This I say without boasting, for
